Jinja2 templates use double curly braces (`{{ ... }}`) to enclose expressions and control structures.\\n\\n2. **Dynamic Content:** With templates, you can dynamically insert data into HTML pages based on the values of variables passed from the Flask application. This enables the creation of dynamic, data-driven web pages.\\n\\n3. **Template Inheritance:** Jinja2 supports template inheritance, allowing you to create a base template with a common structure (e.g., header, footer) and extend or override specific blocks in child templates.\\n\\nThe `render_template()` function in Flask is used to render templates and generate HTML responses. It takes the template file\\'s name as an argument, along with any data that needs to be passed to the template.
